Version: 1.0, Last updated: 12/19/2009

jQuery getObject allows you to get and set properties of an object via
dot-delimited name string. Inspired by the Dojo methods of the same names.

Visit the [project page](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-getobject-plugin/) for more information and usage examples!

### Note for Dojo users ###

The setObject, getObject, and exists methods are similar to their Dojo
counterparts, with the exception that exists returns true or false based
on whether or not a property is defined, not whether it is truthy.
